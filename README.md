## Fixed Data Table

>Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]<br>
>(https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


This project displays a table with data coming from 2 separate APIs. Ads Name column is from "ads" API and the rest of the columns are from "ad_metrics" API. You will see Ads Name column locked and the other columns are scrollable under that.

## Getting Started

### 2. `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>
If the port is not available, you will be prompted if you want to serve the app at the next available port i.e. 3001, etc.

### 3. `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### 4. `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
The app is ready to be deployed!
